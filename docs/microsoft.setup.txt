how to register the half-now oauth app with microsoft
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app

no need for a tenant at this stage, so ignore step 2

redirect uri: https://half-now.firebaseapp.com/__/auth/handler

does this work? i haven't tried it.
https://half-now.null.place/__/auth/handler

copy out the client id from the overview page then create a new secret

was entra even needed?? i don't think so.

try using the app registration in azure portal instead

no luck. i'm getting this with both:
We're unable to complete your request
unauthorized_client: The client does not exist or is not enabled for consumers.
If you are the application developer, configure a new application through the App Registrations in the Azure
Portal at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908.

solution: don't use the ID of the secret in firebase. use the
application id from the overview page as the id that goes into firebase stackoverflow.com/a/70670961
