some providers will only allow a redirect url that is https. if you can't be
bothered setting this up locally then use ngrok as a https proxy to your http
localhost.

download ngrok: ngrok.com/download
install it:
$ sudo tar xvzf ~/Downloads/ngrok-v3-stable-linux-amd64.tgz -C /usr/local/bin

add the auth token:
$ ngrok config add-authtoken xxxxxxxxxx

firebase serve is already running a website on localhost:5000 so point ngrok at
this:
$ ngrok http 5000

it will create a new domain on the fly for you:

Forwarding  https://xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-xxxx-xxxx.au.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:5000

copy this domain into firebase under the authorized domains (add domain):
https://console.firebase.google.com/u/2/project/half-now/authentication/settings

and copy it into the facebook Allowed Domains for the JavaScript SDK:
